# projectileexploit

Because the best way to get this thing patched is to have everyone use it.

~~Might be outdated, fix it yourself.~~ 

Tested and working in EU as of 2017-08-16 17:55 UTC. You need to place the def file in your tera-data/protocol folder, otherwise no memes for you.

If you can't find it for some reason, just search for C_HIT_USER_PROJECTILE.1.def and put it next to it.

```

// !pe                      -> Turn projectile exploit on and off. 
// !peall                   -> Make projectile exploit target all entities in your render range.
// !shiftpos <units>        -> Shift your vertical position by <units> units. 
//                             Can make you invincible by shifting you into the ground, but you will lose aggro and mobs will reset.
//                             If you're too far out of the level bounds, you might be unable to use skills.
//                             The server might actually send you out of the level bounds if you make it update your client position (i.e. jaunt, lag, etc).
//                             A noclip or warp cheat is recommended to get back in.
// 
// !pes <tick> <iterations> -> Projectile exploit will send at most <iterations> packets every <tick> milliseconds. 
//                             Increase <tick> and/or decrease <iterations> if you're getting kicked from EU.
//                             Default is 50 | 2.
//
// Happy hunting!
