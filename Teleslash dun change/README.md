How to use teleslash
Commands

!pe false,no,n,0 - Turns off teleslash.

!pe true,yes,y,1 - Turns on teleslash, once you cast dreamslash any mobs hit by it will activate the module.

!pe all,a,2, - Teleslash will target all Monsters/Players in your render range.

!pe npcs,3 - Will target all Monsters.

!pe users,4 - Targets ALL players added to your target list.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
!ts scan - Scans your current area and adds everyone to your target list.

!ts Name - Adds a user to your teleslash target list, you will be able to kill anyone outside of a safe zone from another continent or region.

Pro tip, if you for example want to kill people in velika outskirts add them or scan them in to your target list and teleport to another region, the game will not tell the player who killed him.

Bugs

There is currently a big bug in the teleslash module where your damage will drop to shit. To fix that you can type !resetfull to clear all the data, doing that will clear your mob spawn data,
target list etc.


For example, if you want to do max damage to a boss type !pe 1 and bind !resetfull command to E quick message list like such. https://i.imgur.com/dbSDSjo.png

This command will clear all currently logged mob data so you will be unable to kill them with !pe 3 command enabled, to kill them turn on !pe 1.
